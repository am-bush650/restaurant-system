# CLI RESTAURANT SYSTEM


This is a CLI-based restaurant management system built using Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy ORM. It allows users to:


ğŸ“Œ Manage Orders (Create, View, Delete)

ğŸ“Œ Manage Menu Items (Create, View, Delete)

ğŸ“Œ Link Orders to Menu Items (Many-to-Many Relationship)

ğŸ“Œ Seed the Database with Fake Data using Faker

ğŸ“Œ Perform CRUD operations with an Interactive CLI


## Relationships

        ### one-to-many relationship

        -orders - Each order is associated with one customer(customer_name).
        -orders contain multiple items - handled via OrderMenuItem in the many to many setup


        ### many-to-many relationship

        -an order can have multiple menu items
        -a menu item can appear in multiple orders
        the order_menu_items table acts as a join table that links orders and menu_items with an additional quantity column

ğŸ“Œ orders â†’ Stores customer orders. 

    order_id(primary key), customer_name, order_date, total_amount

ğŸ“Œ menu_items â†’ Stores restaurant menu items. 

    item_id,(primary key), item_name, price

ğŸ“Œ order_menu_items â†’ Links orders and menu items.
